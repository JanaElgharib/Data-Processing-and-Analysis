# Data Processing and Analysis

This project focuses on customer segmentation through preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and unsupervised learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

A comprehensive data pipeline was applied to a customer dataset to identify meaningful clusters and behavioral patterns.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant features, and prepared data for analysis.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve cluster separation.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualized data distributions and feature relationships using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

- **Clustering Techniques**  
  Implemented and compared the following clustering algorithms:
  - KMeans
  - Agglomerative Clustering
  - DBSCAN
  - BIRCH

- **Evaluation**  
  Assessed clustering performance both qualitatively (via visualizations) and quantitatively (e.g., inertia, silhouette score).

## 📁 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Outcome

Successfully identified distinct customer groups, enabling deeper insights into behavioral trends and potential targeting strategies.
